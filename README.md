Best Practice is a meant for musicians to better structure, organize, and plan their rehearsals.
Best Practice allows users to add the songs that they are practicing to their repoitoire, as well as log how long and how frequently they practice their music. Best Practice also records all practice history for the songs a user practices indefinately to get a true picture of your practice habits so that time can be better managed and pieces can be better addressed and polished
Its the ideal program for musicians who need support managing how they practice music.

To start, just create an account with a unique username and password. Then, find the songs you are practicing from the Best Practice Database (and if you can't find what you are looking for you can add it yourself), and log the songs that you practice and for how long. Best Practice will take care of the rest.

Best Practice was built using React, Javascript, RESTful API's, and CSS.

To start this program locally, just download the code and its packages, then type "npm start" in the command line to run the repository locally.

This program is dedicated to all musicians and artists who spend their free time devoted to improving their craft. Special thanks to my advisor Jaina Morgan for her support, as well as to Elena Aragon for her help and critiques on the UX of Best Practice.
