Best Practice is a fullstack program meant for musicians to better structure, organize, and plan their rehearsals.
Best Practice allows users to add the songs that they are practicing to their repoitoire, as well as log how long and how frequently they practice their music. Best Practice also records a user's practice history until said song is deleted to get a true picture of your practice habits so that time can be better managed and practice can be more productive. Its the ideal program for musicians who need support managing how they practice music.

To start, just create an account with a unique username and password. Then, find the songs you are practicing from the Best Practice Database ( if you can't find what you are looking for, you can add it yourself), and log the songs that you practice and for how long. Best Practice will take care of the rest.

This program is dedicated to all musicians and artists who spend their free time devoted to improving their craft. Special thanks to my advisor Jaina Morgan for her support, as well as to Elena Aragon for her help and critiques on the UX of Best Practice.
